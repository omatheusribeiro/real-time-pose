# 🤖 Real-Time Pose Application

## 📌 Overview
The **Real-Time Pose Application** is an advanced system designed to capture and classify real-time body movements using the **TensorFlow** library and **ReactJS**. 🚀

This repository contains an implementation of:

✅ **Real-Time Body Pose Detection and Movement Classification** 🏋️🤸‍♂️🤼

## 📝 Description
This application leverages the pre-trained **PoseNet** model from **TensorFlow.js** to detect real-time body poses through a connected webcam.

The interface displays a live webcam feed, tracks the user's performed movements, and counts the repetitions for each exercise.
